Getting Started with Shippable
==============================

Introduction
------------
Shippable is a SaaS platform that lets you easily add Continuous Integration/Deployment to your Github and BitButcket (git) repositories. It is lightweight, super simple to setup, and runs your builds and tests faster than any other service. After building and teting your code, you can deploy it to any PaaS provider like Heroku & OpenShift and also to VMs, bare metal, OpenStack clusters, or any major infrastructure provider.
